Lets specify an algorithmic problem as 
* a problem that describes a complete set of instances an algorithm must work on  
* The algorithms output after running on any specific instance

We can define an algorithm as a procedure that takes any possible input instance and transforms it into the desired output
* Ideally this is *general* meaning given the necessary concessions the algorithm can run on any instance

There are 3 properties of a good algorithm
* Correctness
* Efficiency
* Easy of implementation

Algorithm **correctness** is usually dictated by a proof of correctness, explaining *why* we know the algorithm produces the desired result on any given input instance.
