If we cannot reason about correctness using counterexamples, we must use a proof.
One of the common ways to do this is is by using a *proof by induction* where you
1. Prove some base case is trivially true
2. Assume this is true for some value up to n - 1
3. Prove that if the statement is true for n-1 it must be true for n

Induction can be confusing but is in fact the basis for recursive functions both are generally the same

When utilizing inductive proofs there are two common reasoning errors
1. Boundary errors - such as when dealing with certain minimum or maximums in the problem
2. Extension - in some cases the optimal solution for a problem may change or cease to exist if the problem is extended enough
