As we've shown its extremely important and subtle to reason about algorithmic correctness. The best tool to distinguish correct algorithms from heuristics is a *proof*

Proofs are structured into 3 parts
1. The statement of what we're trying to prove
2. A set of assumptions taken to be true
3. A chain of reasoning taking us from those true assumptions to our initial statement

It's important when thinking about algorithms we make sure the problem is well specified, there are two things to consider
1. The set of allowed instances
2. The requirements of the output

If we don't have well defined instances our algorithmic problem could be impossible to prove the correctness of.
* In fact a good strategy is to narrow the set of allowable instances until we have a correct and efficient algorithm

If we don't have well defined output requirements the problem could become difficult to solve specifically
* We could have ill defined questions that don't give proper detail
* We could have compound goals, even if the goals are well defined this makes the problem more complex

Once we have properly defined our algorithmic problem we need to carefully describe it, there are 3 ways of doing so
* English - The most natural but least precise
* Programming language - The least natural but most precise
* Pseudocode - somewhere in the middle

Each way of describing the algorithm has its place, the important thing is to use a notation that allows you to both clearly and accurately describe the algorithm

A good way of proving an algorithm is incorrect is by finding counter examples good counterexamples are
* Verifiable - We can prove the output of the algorithm in some case is not the best output
* Simple - All unnecessary detail from the counter example must be stripped away
