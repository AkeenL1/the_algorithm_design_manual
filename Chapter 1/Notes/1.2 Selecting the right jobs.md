Lets consider another example, here we're given a list of jobs each taking some amount of time. Each job possibly overlaps another job, our goal is to maximize the number of jobs we can take on.
The algorithmic problem can be formalized as
```
Problem: Scheduling
Input: A set I of n intervals on the line
Output: The largest subset of mutually non-overlapping intervals that can be selected from I
```

As an example if this our our input what are some options to find the correct output

1. We could select the earliest job first however this may fail if the input changes where the earliest job overlaps all other jobs
2. We could select the shortest job first, however this would also fail if the shortest job overlaps all other jobs
3. Like in our previous example we could exhaustively find all possible solutions, in this case we only need to iterate over $2^{n}$ subsets which is much less than $n!$ however it's still inefficient on large data sets

Luckily for us the problem *does* have a solution, that is picking the first job to terminate - x. This works because any job that started before x would overlap with x itself and also possibly blocks out jobs ahead of it. By greedily choosing the next job to terminate earliest we know we're maximizing our number of jobs

The key to note here is we thought of many different algorithms but disproved them through *counterexamples* and settled upon an algorithm in which we proved its correctness
