An algorithmic problem is defined as
* A problem that describes a complete set of instances an algorithm must work on  
* The output after running the algorithm on any specific instance of the problem

We can define an algorithm as a procedure that takes any possible input instance of an algorithmic problem and transforms it into some desired output
* This *general* meaning given the adaptations the algorithm can run on any instance
	* EX. A sorting algorithm must be able to sort any list of values regardless of their data type ( string, integer, character etc. )

There are 3 properties of a good algorithm
* Correctness
* Efficiency
* Easy of implementation

Algorithm **correctness** is usually dictated by a ***proof*** of correctness, explaining *why* we know the algorithm produces the desired result on ***any*** given input instance.
